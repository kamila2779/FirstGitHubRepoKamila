OOPS
OOOPS stands for Object Oriented Programming Sistem.
Talking about OOPS I want to mention few basic concepts. All that 
are connected to each other.
First I want to talk about INHERITANCE. One class can inherited
functions and variables from another class using 'extends' key-word.
But if the class has access modifier private, it cannot be inherited
by other classes. This is the example of concept INCAPSULATION. 
It is four types of access modifiers: public - visible for all project,
private - visible for the class only, protected - visible to the packaje
and all subclasses, by default - visible to the package.
I want to mention one more concept - polymorphizm and two 
examples of polymorphizm - method overloading and method overriding. 
Within one class we cannot make duplicate methods, but we can have few methods in one class 
with the same name, but with different arguments or input parameters
This concept calls method overloading. 
We can use the extended method with the same name, but with other function, 
and the preference will be given to the child's method. This concept
calls method overriding.
One more concept is abstruction. I dont know how the key words and methods work, but I know 
what it does and how can I use it.
